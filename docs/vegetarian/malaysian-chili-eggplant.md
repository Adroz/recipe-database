* Serves: 4
* Time required: 60 mins
* Origin: [Daily Cooking Quest](https://dailycookingquest.com/terong-balado-eggplants-with-chili-sauce.html)

## Ingredients
### Spice Paste
* 1 fresh red chilli, seeded if you want less heat
* 100g shallots, peeled and roughly chopped
* 6 cloves garlic, peeled
* 2 teaspoon salt

### Eggplant
* 5-6 Chinese eggplants (about 750g), quartered lengthwise and cut into 3" pieces.
* 8 tbsp neutral cooking oil like rice bran oil or canola oil
* 30 gram tamarind paste
* 50g palm sugar or brown sugar
* 1.5 cups water

## Method
1. As you cut eggplants, soak them in cold water that has been sprinkled with plenty of salt to prevent them from turning brown.

### Spice paste
1. Blend all the spice paste ingredients in a food processor until smooth.

### Eggplant
1. Heat cooking oil (`8 tbsp`) in a wok or wide frypan on high heat. Pat dry eggplants. When the oil is hot, fry for about 2 minutes to bring out the color (eggplants should sizzle when they hit the pan. If they don't, wait for oil to heat more). Drain over a wire rack to remove excess oil, and set aside.
1. Remove all but 1 tbsp oil from the pan. Heat the oil and stir fry the spice paste until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes.
1. Add tamarind paste (`30g`), sugar (`50g`), and water (`1.5 cups`). Boil for about 2-3 minutes.
1. Toss in the fried eggplants and boil again for another 2 minutes. Remove from heat and serve with steamed white rice.
