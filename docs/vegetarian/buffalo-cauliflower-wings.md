## Method
1. Combine water (`2l`), vinegar (`250ml`), salt (`50g`), and sugar (`20g`) in a large saucepot. Bring it to a boil.
1. Cut cauliflower (`1 head`) into florets by removing the bottom of its stem with a paring knife, then cutting it into 8ths on its longitude axis. Cut each eigth into 2-inch florets with a good amount of stem for each floret.
1. Remove saucepot from heat and add the in-tact pieces of cauliflower. Leave the small crumbly pieces behind and save them for another meal. Let the cauliflower sit in the brine to pickle for 1 hour.
1. Meanwhile, combine buttermilk (`300g`) and franks hot sauce (`30g`) in a small bowl. In another medium bowl, combine flour (`175g`), rice flour (`175g`), salt (`5g`), baking powder (`5g`), pepper (`5g`), and paprika (`5g`).
1. Remove cauliflower florets from brine and let drain on paper towels. A few at a time, dredge florets in the flower mixture, then the buttermilk mixture, then back in the flour mixture. Tip: use slotted spoon for wet mixture and tongs for dry to keep your hands clean and your utensils separate.
1. Heat rice bran oil (`500ml`) in a medium saucepan until it reaches 350°F/175°C. Fry cauliflower in batches for 4 minutes. Tip: don't disturb cauliflower florets in oil for the first minute to let the crust set up.
1. In a small saucepan, combine franks hot sauce (`300g`), worcestershire sauce (`20g`), and minced garlic (`15g or 4 cloves`). Simmer for 10 minutes on low. Add butter (`115g`) slowly, mixing after each addition to emulsify. Pour about 1/4 cup of this mixture into a small bowl. Stir in cornstarch/cornflour (`1 tbsp`) to make slurry. Once mixed, add it back to the sauce and cook for another 5 minutes.
1. Finally, toss the cauliflower with the buffalo sauce in a bowl. Serve with ranch or bleu cheese dressing.
