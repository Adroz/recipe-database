* Serves: 8
* Time required: 30 mins
* Origin: [Cooking Classy](https://www.cookingclassy.com/mac-and-cheese/)

## Ingredients
* 16 oz. or 500g cavatappi or pasta curls
* 4 tbsp or 60g butter
* 4 tbsp or 35g flour
* 550ml or 2 1/3 cups milk
* 1 tsp dijon mustard
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* 115g or 4 oz. cream cheese, ripped into smaller pieces
* 225g or 8 oz.  extra sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
* 115g or 4 oz. mozzarella cheese, shredded
* Reserved pasta water

## Method
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, boil pasta ('16oz or 500g`) to al dente according to package instructions. Drain pasta and reserve at least 1 cup of pasta water.
1. While pasta is draining, in the same saucepan, melt butter (`4 tbsp or 60g`) over medium heat then add flour (`4 tbsp or 35g`). Cook 1 minute whisking constantly.
1. Slowly pour in milk (`550 ml`), 100ml at a time, until the liquid is fully absorbed by the roux. Add in mustard ( `1 tsp`) and garlic powder (`1/4 tsp`). Increase heat slightly, then bring mixture to a gentle simmer whisking constantly.
1. Reduce heat to low add in cream cheese (115g or 4oz) and whisk until melted. Whisk in cheddar ('225g or 8oz) and mozzerella (`115g or 4oz) half at a time until fully melted. Season sauce with salt to taste.
1. Add drained pasta to cheese sauce and add pasta water as needed to thin out the sauce. Serve immediately.

## Notes
* Don't use pre-shredded cheese or the sauce might end up grainy and gritty. Shred it yourself for a nice smooth sauce.
* You can sub mustard for 1/2 tsp of mustard powder if you like.
* Don't rinse the pasta. It adds starches and helps thicken up the sauce and keeps the sauce clinging to the pasta.
* Want a crunchy topping? Try saut√©ing panko bread crumbs in a skillet in a little melted butter or olive oil until golden brown. Sprinkle over individual servings so it stays crisp.
