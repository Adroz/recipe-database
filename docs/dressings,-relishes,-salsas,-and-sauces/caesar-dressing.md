* Serves: 4
* Time required: 10 mins
* Origin: [Once Upon a Chef](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/caesar-salad-dressing.html)

## Ingredients
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 1.5 tsp fish sauce or anchovy paste
* 2.5 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
* 1 tsp dijon mustard
* 1 tsp worcestershire sauce
* 1 cup mayonnaise
* ½ cup grated parmesan cheese
* ¼ tsp salt
* ¼ tsp pepper

## Method
1. Combine the garlic (`3 cloves`), fish sauce (`1.5 tsp`), lemon juice (`2.5 tbsp`), dijon mustard (`1 tsp`), and worcestershire sauce (`1 tsp`). Add the mayonnaise (`1 cup`), parmesan cheese (`1/2 cup`), salt (`1/4 tsp`), and pepper (`1/4 tsp`). Whisk until well combined.
1. Taste and adjust to your liking—consider adding more acid (lemon or mustard), salt (salt or parmesan cheese), fat (mayonnaise), or umami (garlic, fish sauce, or worcestershire).

## Notes
The dressing will keep well in the fridge for about a week.
