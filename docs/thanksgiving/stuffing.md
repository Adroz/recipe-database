## Ingredients
### Sage Sausage
* 500g pork
* 1/2 tsp onion powder
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tbsp fresh or dried sage, finely chopped
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper

### Remaining ingredients
* 1 onion, finely diced
* 2 carrots, finely diced
* 2 celert ribs, finely diced
* 1 tbsp thyme
* 2 tbsp fresh or dried sage
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 4 cups turkey or chicken broth
* 1 large loaf of high-quality rustic sourdough bread, sliced and cubed into 1cm cubes, left out overnight to stale or artificially staled in a very low temperature oven as long as needed until crispy and dry, about 1.5 hours at around 100°C or as low as your oven will go
* 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
* 1 egg
* 6 tbsp butter, divided

## Method
1. Add the pork (`500g`) to a large dutch oven on medium-high heat. Add the onion powder (`1/2 tsp`), garlic powder (`1/2 tsp`), sage (`1 tbsp`), salt (`1 tsp`), and pepper (`1 tsp`). Fry and break up into small pieces until browned.
1. Remove the sausage and set aside, leaving any rendered fat behind in the pan. Add butter (`2 tbsp`). Add the diced onion (`1`), carrot (`2`), and celery (`2`). Cook for 6 minutes.
1. Add thyme (`1 tbsp`), sage (`2 tbsp`), and garlic (`1 clove`). Deglaze pot with some of the turkey stock (`4 cups`). Add the sausage back to the pan. Add the dried bread and and remaining stock in quarters, alternating between them.
1. Mix in parmesan cheese (`1/2 cup`) and season with salt and pepper to taste. Let it cool. Once cooled, add egg (`1`).
1. Either keep it in the dutch oven, or transfer to another oven-safe dish. Add paps of butter (`4 tbsp`) on top of the stuffing. Bake at 200°C for 30 minutes or until crisp.
