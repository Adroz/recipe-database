## Method
### Dough
1. Add the yeast (`7g or 2 1/4 tsp`) to a large bowl oro the bowl of a stand mixer, if using. Add warm water (`285g or 1 1/4 cup`). Mix and let sit until you see small bubbled rising to the surface, about 10-15 minutes.
1. Add the olive oil (`20g or 1.5 tbsp`), flour (`425g or 3 cups`), and salt (`8g or 1.5 tsp`) to the bowl and either mix with the dough hook attachment on low for 3 minutes or mix with a metal spoon until the dough comes to a messy ball. Increase speed to high and continue to mix or knead by hand for about 6 minutes. You will know your dough is ready when you can gently pull a piece of it and it doesn't sheer or tear.
1. Transfer dough to a well oiled rectangular container (so that it's the same shape as the sheet pan after it proofs), cover, and allow to rise at room temp for 30 minutes.
1. Fold strength into dough by folding in the 4 sides and flipping it over so the seams face down. Cover and allow to rise again at room temp for 30min.
1. Repeat strength building folds. Cover and allow to rise for yet another 30 minutes.
1. Grease a half sheet pan (about 18" x 13") with butter. Add about 1 tbsp olive oil and spread it around with your hands into all the corners. Turn dough out onto the pan. Oil your fingers and gently de-gas and spread the dough towards the edges of the pan. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes.
1. Stretch the dough again toward the edges of the pan. Let sit covered for another 15 minutes.
1. Stretch the dough all the way to the edges by pulling the dough slightly over the edge of the pan letting it snap back into the edge of the pan. Let sit just 15 minutes more.

### Sauce
1. Put all of the sauce ingredients into a medium saucepan. Heat over medium heat until simmering. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 20 minutes until reduced and dragging spoon through leaves a trail. Cool in the fridge.

### Pizza
1. Preheat oven to 475F/250C. If you have a pizza stone or steel, place it on the lower 1/3 rack.
1. Cover dough edge to edge with slices of mozz (`12`). Spoon sauce in large dollops down in two rows on the pizza, then spread slightly, leaving some cheese exposed. Add fresh mozzarella chunks (`200g`) and pepperonis (`150g`). Sprinkle with grated parmesan cheese. Bake directly on pizza steel or stone  (if using) for 20-25 min or to your desired doneness. Rotate 180 degrees halfway through cooking. Make sure to check the bottom of the pizza. If the bottom is not quite done, transfer the pizza to a gas stove or nonstick pan to crisp up the bottom.
1. Garnish with shredded fresh basil if desired.
