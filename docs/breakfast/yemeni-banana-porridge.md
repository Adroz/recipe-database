## Ingredients
6 ripe bananas
4 wholemeal pita, naan or stale bread slices (or just sub with rolled oats)
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons honey, plus extra to serve
100 ml pouring cream, plus extra to serve
1 cup (180 g) pitted dates, chopped
Â¼ cup (30 g) slivered almonds

## Method
1. Mash 4 of the bananas to a smooth mash. Using a food processor, grind the bread into fine breadcrumbs.
1. Combine the banana and breadcrumbs in a small saucepan with 2 tbsp of butter, and the honey (`2 tbsp`) and cream (`100ml`). Place over a medium heat and gently warm, stirring regularly, for about 5 minutes until the mixture forms a thick, warm pudding.
1. Slice the remaining bananas (`2`) into 1 cm rounds. Heat a small frying pan over a medium heat and add the remaining butter (`1 tbsp`). Fry the banana slices for just a few minutes until golden brown.
1. Serve the porridge warm or at room temperature topped with the fried bananas, dates (`180g`), almonds (`30g`) and a little extra honey and cream.
