# Anzac Biscuit Pancakes
* Serves: 3-4
* Time required: 30 mins
* Origin: Adapted from [ANZAC Pancakes](https://amcarmenskitchen.com/2014/04/25/anzac-pancakes/)

## Ingredients
* 1 cup plain flour
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 cup rolled oats
* 1/2 cup desiccated coconut
* 1 cup milk
* 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
* 1 large egg
* 3 tbsp golden syrup
* butter, for cooking
* butter and golden syrup, for topping

## Method
1. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour (`1 cup`), baking powder (`2 tsp`), salt (`1/2 tsp`), rolled oats (`1/2 cup`), and coconut (`1/2 cup`). Make a well in the center.
1. Add milk (`1 cup`), butter (`2 tbsp`), egg (`1`), and golden syrup (`3 tbsp`). Whisk wet and dry ingredients together until well combined (do not overmix, a few small lumps are fine).
1. Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat. Grease with butter. Ladle the batter onto the pan and cook until the surface of the pancake starts to bubble, about 3 minutes. Flip carefully with a spatula, and cook until browned on the underside, about 1-2 minutes more.
1. Mix equal parts butter and golden syrup as a topping for these delicious pancakes. Enjoy!
