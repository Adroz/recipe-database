## Ingredients
* 3 cups chilled leftover mashed potatoes
* 2 eggs
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 teaspoon pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup breadcrumbs or 1/2 cup flour
* 1 cup shredded cheddar or tasty cheese
* 2 spring onions, chopped
* 1 cup frozen peas
* extra flour, for coating
* 3 tbsp oil, for frying

## Method
1. In a large bowl, mix the mashed potatoes (`3 cups`), eggs (`2`), onion powder (`1 tsp`), garlic powder (`1 tsp`), pepper (`1/2 tsp`), and salt (`1/2 tsp`) together in a bowl.
1. Stir in the breadcrumbs (`1 cup`) or flour (`1/2 cup`), cheese (`1 cup`), spring onions (`2`), and frozen peas (`1 cup`).
1. Form the mixture into 3-inch patties by rolling them into a ball and flattening them until they're about a 1/2 inch thick. Dredge each patty in extra flour. 
1. Heat oil (`3 tbsp`) in a nonstick pan until hot and fry each patty for about 4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy.Do not overcrowd the pan and do not flip the pancakes too soon or they won't develop a crisp crust. Transfer the pancakes to a paper towel-lined plate and immediately sprinkle them with salt.
