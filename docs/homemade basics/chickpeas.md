## Ingredients
* 2 cups dried beans
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 sprig rosemary
* 1 dried or fresh chile, deseeded
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 garlic clove, smashed
* salt
* water
* extra virgin olive oil
## Method
1. Add dried beans (`2 cups`) to a big bowl and cover with cool, filtered water 3 inches above the beans. Add a teaspoon of baking soda and stir. Let sit overnight on the counter.
2. Drain and rinse beans. Add beans, rosemary (`1 sprig`), chile (`1`), bay leaf (`1`), garlic (`1 clove`), and salt (`1.5 tsp`) to a large pot. Add filtered water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to boil and reduce to simmer.
3. Simmer for 30-60 minutes or until beans become soft enough to lose crunch (they will still be dry and crumbly inside). Add more salt (`1 tsp`) and a glug of olive oil. Continue to simmer until done. You'll know when they are done when they get quite creamy and a few beans split.
4. Take off heat and let cool in their bean liquid.
