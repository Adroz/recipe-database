* Serves: 6
* Time required: 1 hour
* Origin: Adapted from [Tomato Sauce with Onion and Butter](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015375-tomato-sauce-with-onion-and-butter)

## Ingredients
* 2 pounds fresh ripe tomatoes, blanched, or 800g canned whole Italian tomatoes with their juice
* 5 tablespoons butter
* 1 medium onion, peeled and cut in quarters
* Salt, to taste
## Method
1. Put tomatoes (`800g`) in a medium saucepan over low heat. Add the butter (`5 tbsp`) and onion (`1`). Cook covered low and slow for about 45 minutes, or until it is thickened to your liking and the fat floats free from the tomato.
1. Stir from time to time, mashing up large pieces of tomato with the back of a wooden spoon. Taste and add salt to you liking.
1. Sauce can be used at this stage, but if you would like, you can wait for the sauce to cool and blend it in a food processor until smooth. Return smooth sauce to heat and serve with your favorite pasta.
