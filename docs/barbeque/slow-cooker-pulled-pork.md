## Ingredients
* 1 boneless or bone-in pork shoulder (also known as pork butt), approximately 3-4lbs or 1.5-2kgs, twine or netting removed
* 3 tbsp chili powder (if making your own, mix equal parts dried chili, garlic powder, cumin, paprika, and oregano)
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 2 tsp ground coriander
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper
* 5 cloves garlic, minced or grated
* 2 yellow onions, sliced thinly
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 3 tbsp apple cider vinegar
* 1/4 cup fresh lime juice

## Method
1. Combne the chili powder (`3 tbsp`), brown sugar (`2 tbsp`), coriander (`2 tsp`), cumin (`2 tsp`), salt (`2 tsp`), and pepper (`1 tsp`). Rub all over the pork shoulder (`3-4lbs/1.5-2kgs`) and place in the bottom of a slow cooker turned to high.
1. Add minced garlic (`5 cloves`), sliced onions (`2`), tomato paste (`2 tbsp`), and apple cider vineger (`3 tbsp`) on top and around the sides of the pork.
1. Cook on high for 6 hours or low for 10 hours. Stir once halfway through cooking.
1. Turn off the slow cooker and transfer the pork to a cutting board. If the pork has a bone in it, remove and discard it. Use two forks to shred the meat, discarding any connective tissue, and large clumps of fat. Return the shredded pork to the slow cooker and stir well.
1. Add fresh lime juice (`1/4 cup`), salt, and barbeque sauce to taste.
