## Ingredients
* 1/2 tbsp black pepper
* 3 garlic cloves, crushed
* 2 tsp light brown sugar
* 1 tsp cornstarch/cornflour
* 1 tsp salt
* 500g beef mince
* 1 tbsp oil
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 1/2 head small green cabbage, thinly sliced, ideally on a mandolin
* 1 tbsp black vinegar (Chinkiang vinegar)
* 1 tbsp chinese cooking wine (Shaoxing wine)
* 1 tbsp sesame seeds
* 2 scallions, thinly sliced
* Cooked rice, for serving

## Method
1. Add black pepper (`1/2 tbsp`), garlic (`3 cloves`), brown sugar (`2 tsp`), cornstarch (`1 tsp`), and salt (`1 tsp`) in a medium bowl and stir to combine. Add the beef (`500g`) to the mixture ands tir to combine.
1. Heat the oil in a large cast-iron pan or dutch oven on medium-high. Add beef mixture and cook, letting the beef brown before breaking it up and stirring well. Cook for about 5 minutes. Add soy sauce (`2 tbsp`) and stir. Transfer cooked beef to a bowl using a slotted spoon, leaving behind the fat rendered from the beef in the pan.
1. Add cabbage (`1/2 head`) to the pan and let cook, undisturbed, for 1 minute so that some pieces caramelize in the pan. Toss and cook cabbage, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Stir in vinegar (`1 tbsp`), cooking wine (`1 tbsp`), and salt to taste.
1. Add the cooked beef and all juices back to the pan, and stir until well combined with the cabbage and warmed through, about 1 minute.
1. Serve in bowls over rice and top with sesame seeds and scallions.
