## Ingredients
* 1 brown onion, sliced
* 2 green onions, thinly sliced
* 500g beef rib eye (or chuck), thinly sliced and cut ~7cm wide (cut up shabu shabu meat works great)
* 240ml dashi
* 1 Tbsp sugar
* 4 Tbsp sake
* 4 Tbsp mirin
* 6 Tbsp soy sauce
* 2 cups short-grain rice
* [Optional for Tanindon] 4 eggs, beaten

## Method
1. Start cooking the rice (`2 cups`), as the rest of the dish can be prepared and cooked by the time the rice is done.
2. Add the dashi (`240ml`), sugar (`1 Tbsp`), sake (`4 Tbsp`), mirin (`4 Tbsp`), soy sauce (`6 Tbsp`) to a large frying pan. Don't turn on the stove yet.
3. Add the sliced brown onion (`1`) to the frying pan, separating all the layers, spreading them out.
4. Add the beef rib eye (`500g`) on top, put on the lid, then turn on the frying pan to medium heat.
5. When the meat is cooked, reduce to simmer, cooking for another 3-4 minutes (At this point you can skim off the scum and fat if desired).
6. Sprinkle on the green onions (`2`).
7. [Optional for Tanindon] Slowly add the eggs (`4`) on top of the beef. Don't stir them. Re-cover the frying pan and cook until the eggs are *nearly* set.
8. Add the rice to some bowls, and ladle in some sauce and the beef mixture on top.
