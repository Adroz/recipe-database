## Ingredients  
* 1 onion, sliced thinly
* 1 onion, sliced into 1 cm thick pieces  
* 1 (10g) piece ginger, sliced into thin strips  
* 4 cups water  
* 4 tbsp mirin  
* 6 tbsp sake  
* 6 tbsp soy sauce  
* 4 tbsp sugar  
* 400g thinly sliced beef brisket (fatty cuts preferred)  
* 1 tsp dashi powder (optional)  
* 4 bowls cooked rice  
* Pickled red ginger (optional, for garnish)  

## Method  
1. Cut the onions (`2`) in half and remove the core.  
2. Slice onion thinly across the fibers for a softer texture.  
3. Cut the other onbion into thicker (1 cm) slices and separate them into bits.  
4. Slice ginger (`10g`) into thin strips, first lengthwise, then crosswise.  
5. In a pot, add water (`4 cups`), mirin (`4 tbsp`), sake (`6 tbsp`), soy sauce (`6 tbsp`), and sugar (`4 tbsp`). Stir well.  
6. (Optional) Add dashi powder (`1 tsp`) for enhanced umami flavor.  
7. Bring the mixture to a simmer and add thinly sliced beef brisket (`400g`), breaking it apart while adding.  
8. Simmer until foam appears, then skim off the clumps of blood and fat for a cleaner broth.  
9. Reduce heat to medium-low and add thinly sliced onion and ginger (`10g`), ensuring they cover the beef.  
10. Simmer on low to medium heat for 20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the beef to become tender.  
11. Once the broth has reduced by half, add the thicker onion slices for added texture.  
12. Adjust the tenderness of the onions to your preference by tasting along the way.  
13. Serve by placing cooked rice (`4 bowls`) into serving bowls.  
14. Ladle beef and onion mixture over the rice, pouring the sauce first for optimal flavor distribution.  
15. (Optional) Garnish with pickled red ginger for an extra flavor boost.
