## Ingredients
* 6 chicken thigh fillets
* 2 tbsp plain flour
* 1 tsp dried thyme
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 2 brown onions, sliced
* 4 garlic cloves, sliced
* 200g sun-dried tomatoes, sliced
* 150ml tomato passata
* 1 tsp chicken stock powder
* 300ml thickened cream
* 1 cup grated parmesan
* a handful of basil leaves, to serve

## Method
1. Heat the oven to 180C fan-forced. Season the chicken (`6 thighs`) well with salt and pepper and toss with the flour (`2 tbsp`) and thyme (`1 tsp`).
1. Heat a heavy ovenproof pan over medium heat. Add the oil (`2 tbsp`) and fry the chicken until lightly browned. Add the onion (`2`) and garlic (`4 cloves`) around the chicken and fry for about 3 minutes until the onion is starting to take on some colour.
1. Add the sun-dried tomatoes (`200g`), passata (`150ml`), chicken stock powder (`1 tsp`) and cream (`300ml`), and stir to combine and bring to a simmer.
1. Sprinkle the parmesan (`1 cup`) over the top, then transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 20 minutes, uncovered, until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened and reduced. Scatter with the basil leaves (`handful`) to serve.
