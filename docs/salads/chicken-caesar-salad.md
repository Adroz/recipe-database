## Ingredients
* 3 chicken breasts
* 1 head of iceberg lettuce, thinly chopped
* 1/2 - 1 cup [Jessie's Caesar Dressing](https://www.jessiesrecipes.com/dressings%2C-relishes%2C-salsas%2C-and-sauces/caesar-dressing/)
* 4 slices cooked bacon, chopped into 2cm pieces
* 4 eggs, boiled for 7 minutes and chopped into 1/8ths
* 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, grated

## Method
1. Season chicken breasts (`3`) with salt and pepper. Heat a pan with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat. Add a glug of olive oil and add seasoned chicken breasts, top-side down, and let sit undisturbed for 1-2 minutes, until a golden crust forms. Flip chicken breasts and turn heat down to low. Let chicken cook for 10 minutes with the lid on, undisturbed. After 10 minutes, turn off heat and let sit undisturbed with the lid still on (no peaking!) for another 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, put chicken on a cutting board and let sit another 10 minutes. Slice in 5mm slices.
1. Combine iceberg lettuce (`1 head`) with the caesar dressing (`1/2 cup`). Add more dressing to taste.
1. Add cooked bacon (`4 slices `), boiled eggs (`4`), and parmesan cheese (`1/2 cup`).
1. Serve with croutons, in a wrap, with crusty bread, or have it as is.
