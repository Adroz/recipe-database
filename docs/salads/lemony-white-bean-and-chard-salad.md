# Lemony White Bean and Chard Salad
* Serves: 4-6
* Time required: 20mins
* Origin: [Nothing Fancy](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/46011237-nothing-fancy)

## Ingredients
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
* 4 anchovie fillets
* 2 tbsp salted capers, rinsed
* 1 tsp chilli flakes
* 2 (425g) cans white beans (cannellini or navy), drained and rinsed
* 1 head chard, torn into large pieces
* 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves
* 1/2 cup fresh parsley, leaves and stems
* 1 hunk of parmesan, shaved
* 1/2 lemon
## Method
1. Heat the olive oil (`1/4 cup`) in a large frying pan over medium head and add the garlic (`4 cloves`). Cook, swirling the pan occasionally until the garlic is pale golden brown, 3-4 minutes.
2. Add the anchovie fillets (`4`), capers (`2 tbsp`), and chilli flakes (`1 tsp`). Swirl until the anchovies melt and sizzle, the capers pop slightly, and the chilli flakes toast and bleed into the oil, about 2 minutes.
3. Add the beans (`1 (425g) cans`) and season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low and toast to coat. Cook until the flavours have melded, 8-10 minutes.
4. Add half the chard (`1 head`), tossing to cover and letting it wilt slightly.
5. Transfer the contents to the serving dish and mix in the remaining chard. Scatter with the mint (`1/2 cup`) and parsley (`1/2 cup`).
6. Just before serving shave on the parmesan (`1 hunk`) and squeeze on some lemon (`1/2`) juice.
