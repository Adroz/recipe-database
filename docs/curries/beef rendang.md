* Serves: 8
* Time required: 3 hours total (30 minutes active, 2.5 hours passive)
* Origin: [Ayam](https://ayam.com/recipes/malaysian-beef-rendang-slow-cooked) and [Rasa Malaysia](https://rasamalaysia.com/beef-rendang-recipe-rendang-daging/)

## Ingredients
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 700g sirloin, chuck, short rib, or any other good slow cooking beef, cut into 2-3cm chunks
* 185g jar Ayam Malaysian Rendang Curry Paste
* 400ml can Coconut Cream
* 1 cup water
* 1/4 cup shredded coconut
* 1-2 tbsp of brown sugar, to taste
* 1/2-1 tsp salt, to taste
* fresh lime juice, to taste

## Method
1. In a dutch oven on a stovetop set to medium-high, add the olive oil (`2 tbsp`). When it's shimmery, add the chunks of beef (`700g`). Season with salt. Working in batches as needed, brown both sides of each chunk, being sure not to crowd the pot.
1. Once all chunks are browned, return all to the dutch oven, stir in the Ayam Malaysian Rendang Curry Paste, and fry until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
1. Add the coconut cream (`400ml`) and water (`1 cup`). Stir well. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Let it simmmer on low heat for 2.5 hours or until the beef is tender. Optionally, add all the ingredients to a slow cooker and cook on low for 6-8 hours.
1. Toast the coconut (`1/4 cup`) by sprinkling it evenly on a nonstick baking sheet and placing it under a grill for about 5 minutes, checking every 1-2 minutes to ensure it doesn't burn. Remove it when it's a nice even golden brown. Add it to the curry.
1. Toward the end of cooking, add the brown sugar (`1-2 tbsp, to taste`) and salt (`1/2-1 tsp, to taste`). Taste the curry sauce and add more salt, sugar, or acid (lime juice) as needed.
1. If the curry is too thick, add water as needed to bring it to the consistency you like. If the curry is too thin, simmer with the lid off to let moisture evaporate.
1. Serve with steamed rice.
