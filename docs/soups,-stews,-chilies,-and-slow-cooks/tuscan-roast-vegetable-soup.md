## Method
### Roasted Vegetables
1. Set the oven to 190°C/375°F. Place butternut (`1`), onion (`2`), and garlic cloves (`4`) into a roasting pan and season with paprika (`1 tsp`), oregano, (`1 tsp`), thyme (`1 tsp`), salt, pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. Mix well bake until golden, about 20 minutes.

### Soup
2. Place a dutch oven on medium heat and add olive oil (`2 tbsp`). Add the sliced garlic (`4 cloves`) followed by salt, rosemary, thyme, sage leaves (`2 sprigs each`) and parmesan rind (`1`). Let this all infuse for a couple of minutes but don’t let the garlic burn.
3. Pour in the stock (`1500ml`), add the lemon zest (`1 lemon`), lemon juice (`½ lemon`), red wine vinegar (`2 tbsp`) and season with salt and pepper. Return the lid and let this simmer gently for a couple of minutes.
4. Add the pasta (`200g`).
5. When the pasta is al dente, add the kale leaves (`6`) and let this cook for a couple of minutes.
6. Remove from the heat and add the roasted veggies to the soup. Taste for seasoning and add salt or lemon juice if needed.
7. Stir in the cream (`100ml`) and parmesan (`⅓ cup`).
8. Serve instantly in bowls with a grating of parmesan, some black pepper, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.
