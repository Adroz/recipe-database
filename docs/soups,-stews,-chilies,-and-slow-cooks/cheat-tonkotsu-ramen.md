## Ingredients  
* 80g green onion, chopped  
* 400g pork mince (10% fat)  
* 560ml water  
* 8g kombu (or 4g MSG)  
* 800ml unsweetened soy milk  
* 60ml soy sauce  
* 60ml sake  
* 6g salt  
* 6g sugar  
* 14g oyster sauce  
* 20ml neutral oil  
* 32g garlic, minced  
* 520g ramen noodles  
* 2 sheets nori  

## Method  
1. Heat neutral oil (`20ml`) in a pan over medium heat.  
2. Add a pinch of salt and black pepper, then cook the pork mince (`400g`) until it changes color.  
3. Add minced garlic (`32g`) and cook for another 20-30 seconds until aromatic.  
4. Pour in water (`560ml`) and add kombu (`8g`) or MSG (`4g`).  
5. Slowly heat the mixture to around 60°C (140°F) to extract umami flavor from the kombu.  
6. Add sake (`60ml`) and let it boil for 30 seconds to remove alcohol content.  
7. Pour in unsweetened soy milk (`800ml`), soy sauce (`60ml`), salt (`6g`), sugar (`6g`), and oyster sauce (`14g`). Stir well.  
8. In a separate pot, cook ramen noodles (`520g`) according to package instructions using plenty of water to prevent stickiness.  
9. Once the broth is ready, remove kombu and pour it into warmed bowls.  
10. Add the cooked noodles and top with chopped green onion (`80g`).  
11. Garnish each bowl with half a sheet of nori (`2 sheets` total). Serve hot and enjoy!
