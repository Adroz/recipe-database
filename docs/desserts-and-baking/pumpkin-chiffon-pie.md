## Ingredients
### Crust
* 190g plain biscuit (digestives, milk arrowroot, etc.) (should be ~2 cups of crumbs)
* 1.5 Tbsp sugar 
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 85g unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
### Filling
* 1 envelope unflavored gelatin (2½ tsp.)
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
* 1/2 cup sugar, scant
* 1/4 cup sugar, scant
* 1.5 Tbsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 3 large egg yolks
* 3 large egg whites
* 3/4 cup whole milk
* 1¼ cups unsweetened pumpkin purée (about 300g)
* 3/4 cup heavy cream
* 1/4 cup sour cream
## Method
### Crust
1. Preheat oven to 160°C. Pulse biscuits (`190g`) in a food processor until broken down into fine crumbs (you should have about 2 cups). Set aside 2 Tbsp. biscuit crumbs for serving. Add sugar (`1.5 Tbsp`) and salt (`1/4 tsp`) and pulse just to combine. Add butter (`85g`) and pulse until mixture is the consistency of wet sand.
2. Transfer to a 9"-diameter deep pie dish. Press crumbs firmly onto bottom and up sides of dish. Bake crust until fragrant and edges just start to take on color, 20–25 minutes. Let cool.
### Filling and assembly
3. Stir gelatin (`1 envelope`), cinnamon (`1 tsp`), nutmeg (`1/4 tsp`), sugar (`1/2 cup`), and salt (`1/4 tsp`) in a small saucepan. Whisk egg yolks (`3`) and milk (`3/4 cup`) in a small bowl to combine, then whisk into sugar mixture. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until mixture begins to thicken and coats the back of a spoon (but do not let it boil), about 5 minutes. Stir in pumpkin purée (`1 1/4 cup or 300g`) and remove from heat. Transfer to a large bowl and chill until cool, about 10 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat egg whites (`3`) in a large bowl until soft peaks form. With the motor running, gradually add sugar (`1/4 cup`) and continue to beat until stiff peaks form, 5–7 minutes.
5. Mix one-third of egg white mixture into chilled pumpkin mixture until smooth. Gently fold remaining egg white mixture into pumpkin mixture in 2 additions until incorporated, but don’t overmix.
6. Pour filling into biscuit crust; smooth top. Cover and chill overnight.
7. Vigorously whisk cream (`3/4 cup`) in a large bowl until medium peaks form. Fold in sour cream (`1/4 cup`) and remaining sugar (`2 Tbsp`) and salt (`1/4 tsp`) just to combine. If the cream looks like it could use another whisk or two to hold medium peaks, give it a whisk until it reaches the desired consistency. Using a large spoon, dollop a generous amount of whipped cream in the center of pie. Sprinkle with reserved graham cracker crumbs. Slice and serve with any remaining whipped cream alongside.
