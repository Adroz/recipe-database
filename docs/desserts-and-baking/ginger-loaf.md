## 
### For the loaf
1. Pre-heat your oven to 150°C/325°F. Grease and line a loaf tin.
1. In a small saucepan, melt the butter (`100g`), golden syrup (`200g`), and brown sugar (`50g`) on low heat. Once the butter is fully melted and sugar incorporated, leave it to cool for a few minutes.
1. Whisk the eggs (`2`) and milk (`150ml`) in a large bowl. Slowly stream in the hot butter and sugar mixture into the eggs and milk mixture while constantly whisking so you don't scramble the eggs.
1. Sift in the baking soda (`1 tsp`), ground ginger (`1 tbsp`), cinnamon (`1 tsp`), nutmeg (`1/4 tsp`), allspice (`1/4 tsp`), ground clove (`1/4 tsp`), and ground cardamom (`1/4 tsp`).
1. Sift the flour (`225g`) and mix until just incorporated.
1. Pour the mixture into the loaf tin and bake for 1 hour or until it is a rich gold colour and a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean. Leave to cool completely.

### For the drizzle
1. In a bowl or cup with a spout, mix together the icing sugar (`75g`), orange blossom water (`1 tsp`), and milk (`2 tsp`). Drizzle over the cooled loaf. Top with crystallised ginger.
