## Method

### Pie Crust
1. Preheat oven to 160°C. Pulse biscuits (`150g`) in a food processor until broken down into fine crumbs (you should have about 2 cups). Add peanuts (`50g`) and pulse just to combine. Add butter (`85g`) and pulse until mixture comes together.
1. Transfer to a 9"-diameter deep pie dish. Press crumbs firmly onto bottom and up sides of dish. Bake crust until fragrant and edges just start to take on color, 20–25 minutes. Let cool.

### Filling
1. Stir heavy cream (`1 cup`), butter (`2 tbsp`), brown sugar (`50g`), sugar (`75g`), salt (`1/8 tsp`), and bittersweet chocolate (`28g`) in a small saucepan. Whisk until chocolate is melted. Remove from heat and let cool about 10  minutes. Add gelatin (`1 envelope`) and cocoa powder (`75g`)to the cooled mixture.
1. Whisk egg yolks (`3`) and milk (`3/4 cup`) in a small bowl to combine, then whisk into sugar mixture. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until mixture begins to thicken and coats the back of a spoon (but do not let it boil), about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir iin vanilla extract (`1/2 tsp`). Transfer to a large bowl and chill until cool, about 10 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat egg whites (`3`) in a large bowl until soft peaks form. With the motor running, gradually add sugar (`1/4 cup`) and continue to beat until stiff peaks form, 5–7 minutes.
1. Mix one-third of egg white mixture into chilled chocolate mixture until smooth. Gently fold remaining egg white mixture into chocolate mixture in 2 additions until incorporated, but don’t overmix.
1. Pour filling into pie crust; smooth top. Cover and chill overnight.

### Topping
1. Arrange sliced bananas (`2`) on top of set chocolate filling.
1. Vigorously whisk cream (`3/4 cup`) in a large bowl until medium peaks form. Fold in sour cream (`1/4 cup`) and sugar (`2 Tbsp`) and salt (`1/4 tsp`) just to combine. If the cream looks like it could use another whisk or two to hold medium peaks, give it a whisk until it reaches the desired consistency. Using a large spoon, dollop a generous amount of whipped cream in the center of pie. Sprinkle with chopped peanuts.
