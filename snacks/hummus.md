# Ingredients
* 4 cups cooked [chickpeas](https://github.com/Adroz/recipe-database/blob/master/homemade%20basics/chickpeas.md), cooled
* 3 cloves garlic, microplaned
* juice of 1/2 a lemon
* 10 cumin seeds
* 2 tsp some kind of umami (white soy sauce, boullion paste, dashi powder, vegemite, etc)
* 8 oz tahini
* salt, to taste
* more lemon juice, to taste
* toppings: olive oil, pine nuts, paprika, fresh chickpeas, harissa, etc.

# Method
1. Blend chickpeas (`4 cups`) in a food processor for 5 minutes. Add just enough aquafaba to get the mixture to blend well. You want it to be as thick as possible.
2. Microplane garlic (`3 cloves`) into the lemon juice (`1/2 lemon`) and let sit until ready to use.
3. Toast cumin seeds in a pan until they get 2 shades darker. Grind them with a mortar and pestle or spice grinder once cooled.
4. Add lemon mixture, ground toasted cumin seeds (`10 seeds`), and umami (`2 tsp`) to the chickpeas and blend.
5. Next add tahini (`8 oz`) and blend for 10 seconds. Tahini gets bitter if overblended.
6. Season to taste with salt, lemon, more tahini, more cumin, or more umami. You want a nice balance of all these flavors.
7. Top with your favorite toppings when ready to serve.
