# Ingredients
* 1-1.5kg lamb shoulder, broken down into 3-4 pieces for even cooking
* 12 anchovie fillets, finely chopped
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 1kg ripe tomatoes, sliced 1cm thick
* 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
* 2 tbsp lemon juice

# Method
1. Season the lamb (`1-1.5kg`) with salt and pepper, and rub in the achovies (`12 anchovie fillets`) and olive oil (`1/4 cup`). Let the lamb marinate at least 30mins (uncovered and refrigerated).
2. Heat up BBQ or grill to medium-high. Grill the lamb on the hottest part of the grill, flipping frequently to make sure nothing burns. Grill until charred deeply and evenly, ~8mins, depending on the thickness.
3. Transfer lamb to the cutting board, leaving it to rest for 10 minutes.
4. While waiting for the meat, place tomatoes (`1kg`) on a large serving platter and season with salt and pepper. Scatter with garlic (`2 cloves`) and lemon juice (`2 tbsp`).
5. Thinly slice the meat and place atop the tomatoes, letting the juices mingle.
