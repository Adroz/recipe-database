# Method
1. Heat butter (`2 tbsp`) in a pan. Sautee green chilies (`2`) and cashews (`10`). Add onions (`2`) and fry until golden. Add ginger (`1 inch`) and garlic (`2 cloves`) and sautee for 2 minutes. Add cumin powder (`1 tsp`), garam masala (`1 tsp`), and turmeric powder (`1/2 tsp`) and sautee for 1 minute. Add tomatoes (`2`) and salt (`1 tsp`). Sautee for 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water and cook covered until onions are completely soft.
1. Add spinach (`500g`) for 3-4 minutes until leaves wilt and raw spinach smell dissipates. Remove from heat and let cool. In a food processor, blend this to a smooth puree. Add water if you need to.
1. In the same pan, add butter (`1 tbsp`). Then add whole spices: cardamoms (`3`), cinnamon (`1 inch`), cloves (`2`), cumin seeds (`1/4 tsp`), and bay leaf (`1`). Add cubed paneer (`200g`) and sautee for 2 minutes.
1. Lower the heat and add the kasuri methi (`1/2 tsp`) and pureed spinach mixture. Cook for 2-3 minutes. Don't overcook or else the spinach will lose its vibrant colour.
1. Add cream to finish just before serving.
