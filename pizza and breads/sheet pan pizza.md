# Method
## Dough
1. Add the yeast (`7g or 2 1/4 tsp`) to a large bowl oro the bowl of a stand mixer, if using. Add warm water (`285g or 1 1/4 cup`). Mix and let sit until you see small bubbled rising to the surface, about 10-15 minutes.
1. Add the olive oil (`20g or 1.5 tbsp`), flour (`425g or 3 cups`), and salt (`8g or 1.5 tsp`) to the bowl and either mix with the dough hook attachment on low for 3 minutes or mix with a metal spoon until the dough comes to a messy ball. Increase speed to high and continue to mix or knead by hand for about 6 minutes. You will know your dough is ready when you can gently pull a piece of it and it doesn't sheer or tear.
1. Transfer dough to a well oiled rectangular container (so that it's the same shape as the sheet pan after it proofs), cover, and allow to rise at room temp for 30 minutes.
1. Fold strength into dough by folding in the 4 sides and flipping it over so the seams face down. Cover and allow to rise again at room temp for 30min.
1. Repeat strength building folds. Cover and allow to rise for yet another 30 minutes.
1. Grease a half sheet pan (about 18" x 13") with butter. Add about 1 tbsp olive oil and spread it around with your hands into all the corners. Turn dough out onto the pan. Oil your finers and gently degas and spread the dough towards the edges of the pan. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes.
1. Stretch the dough again toward the edges of the pan. Let sit for another 15 minutes.
1. Stretch the dough all the way to the edges by pulling the dough slightly over the edge of the pan letting it snap back into the edge of the pan.
1. Fold strength into dough by folding in the 4 sides and flipping it over so the seams face down. Cover and allow to rise again at room temp for 30min.Repeat strength building folds. Cover and allow to rise for yet another 30 minute 

1. Put all of the sauce ingredients into a medium saucepan. Heat over medium heat until simmering. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 20 minutes until reduced and dragging spoon through leaves a trail.

Add ingredients into the bowl of stand mixer with dough hook attachment and mix on low for 3 minutes or until dough forms into a messy ball. Increase speed to high and continue to mix for about 6min. Transfer dough to well oiled rectangular container, cover, and allow to rise at room temp for 30min. Fold strength into dough as shown @1:59. Cover and allow to rise again at room temp for 30min. Repeat strength building fold @2:34. Cover and allow to rise for yet another 30 minutes. 

Very liberally oil sheet pan, making sure to spread into corners and up the sides. I usually use at least 30ml or 2-3Tbsp. Flip dough onto sheet tray. Spread dough out into rectangular shape. Cover and let rest for 15-20min. After that first rest, continue stretching dough out into the pan. Degas, grab edges, and stretch edge to edge. Cover and allow to relax for 15 minutes. At this point, you should be able to stretch dough the rest of the way to fill the sheet pan. Cover one last time and allow to proof for about 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 550F/288C  with pizza stone or steel placed on the lower 1/3 rack.
